## My process

For this challenge, I just followed Kevin Powell‚Äôs tutorial step by step.  
Watching a master in action really teaches you a lot ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly what happened!

I picked up some cool tips:
- CSS attributes and functions  
- Better understanding of `srcset`  
- How useful custom properties in local scope can be  
- The `.sr-only` utility  

It even made me realize I might be overusing class names üòÖ  
so I added ‚Äúread about **BEM methodology**‚Äù to my to-do list.  

Oh, and it was my first time trying **Firefox‚Äôs responsive mode** ‚Äî pretty cool!
